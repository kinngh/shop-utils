# Shop Utils

A bunch of utils I created to build types for my Shopify app boilerplates. They work and I'm not going to bother explaning them, unless you wanna break your head.

In that case, good luck.

## Boilerplates

- [Express.js x MongoDB](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app): Starter template built on React.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
- [Next.js x Prisma ORM](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app): Starter template built on Next.js and Prisma ORM.
- [WIP] [Next.js x Prisma ORM x TypeScript](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app-typescript): Starter template built on TypeScript, Next.js and Prisma ORM.
- [Polaris Playground](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-polaris-playground): A Next.js and Polaris installation that mimics Shopify's Admin UI so you can build your UI offline, and drag it to the Next.js repo in one go.

## Notes

- Please don't ask me for notes.
- It works and that's all I care about.
