# Shop Utils

Generate related types, with some inconsistencies, in JSDocs and TypeScript types. Scripts auto generate so naming conventions could be way off.

## Boilerplates

- [Express.js x MongoDB](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app): Starter template built on React.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
- [Next.js x Prisma ORM](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app): Starter template built on Next.js and Prisma ORM.
- [Polaris Playground](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-polaris-playground): A Next.js and Polaris installation that mimics Shopify's Admin UI so you can build your UI offline, and drag it to the Next.js repo in one go.
